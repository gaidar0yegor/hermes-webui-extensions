# Changelog

## 1.1.5 — 2026-10-07

- Keep native toast notifications above the theme header, mobile drawer and profile menu.
- Show toasts just below the 52px header, so an error toast can't cover the hamburger, New conversation or Reload buttons.

## 1.1.4 — 2026-10-07

- Keep the native Kanban, Skills and Settings search fields visible; only the chat list's search sits behind the toggle.
- Apply the rounded menu shell to Core's conversation action menu (`.session-action-menu`).
- Size the desktop reasoning chip for its icon and label, with ellipsis instead of clipping.
- Collapse the reasoning chip to its icon when a narrow desktop composer would squeeze the model picker.
- Round and reweight the conversation action menu's rows to match Selene's other menus.
- Keep the fixed Provider quota caption when Core updates the chip's tooltip.
- Replace the mobile dark screenshot with a demo-only capture.
- Run the virtual-list regression behind the shared HTTP/WebSocket network guards with service workers blocked.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-10-07

- Restore native conversation-list scrolling for virtualized histories while keeping the profile pinned.
- Reserve both mobile header actions and preserve native row action padding.
- Hide absent quota data, align its caption/value, and keep context compression at intrinsic width.
- Restore the native header plus and desktop brain icon; focus add-menu items only for keyboard opens.
- Adapt the composer to a narrow desktop chat column with both panels open.
- Move review evidence out of the installable package.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-10-07

- Replace the main desktop/mobile screenshots with a real rendered demo conversation, including user/assistant messages, a checklist and code.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-10-06

- Size desktop composer controls to their visible contents, eliminating unused space before Send when reasoning is hidden or short.
